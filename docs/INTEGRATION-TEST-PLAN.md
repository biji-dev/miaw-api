## 1. Test Strategy

### 1.1 Approach

**Integration Level:** Full stack with real WhatsApp connection

| Component | Testing Method | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| HTTP Client | Real HTTP calls (fetch) | Tests actual API contract |
| Fastify Server | Real server on test port | Tests real routing & middleware |
| MiawClient Instances | **Real instances, WhatsApp connected** | Tests actual miaw-core integration |
| Baileys Socket | **Real connection (paired via QR)** | Tests end-to-end functionality |
| Webhook Consumer | Test HTTP server | Verifies webhook delivery |

### 1.2 What We Test

| Layer | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| HTTP Protocol | Request/response formats, status codes, headers |
| Authentication | API key validation (missing, invalid) |
| Input Validation | All request body validations, error messages |
| Instance Lifecycle | Create, connect, disconnect, delete, restart |
| Message Operations | Send/receive all message types to real WhatsApp |
| Contact Operations | Number validation, contact info retrieval |
| Group Operations | Create, manage, invite, leave groups |
| Webhook Delivery | Event firing, payload format, retry logic |

### 1.3 Test Data Requirements

**Real WhatsApp Connection Required:**
- Test phone number (dedicated, not personal)
- At least 2 test contacts (with WhatsApp)
- Test group (pre-created with contacts)
- Business account (optional, for business features)

**Why Real Connection?**
- Miaw-core behavior differs with real vs mocked socket
- Actual WhatsApp protocol validation
- Real message IDs and timestamps
- Actual media handling
- Real webhook event payloads

---

## 2. Test Environment Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites

#### Required

1. **Test Phone Number**
   - Dedicated WhatsApp number for testing
   - Can scan QR code and remain connected during tests
   - NOT your personal daily number

2. **Test Contacts**
   - Contact A: Standard WhatsApp user (phone visible)
   - Contact B: Standard WhatsApp user (for group tests)
   - Both must have added the test number

3. **Test Group**
   - Pre-created WhatsApp group
   - Test number is admin
   - At least 2 members

#### Optional (for Business Features)

4. **WhatsApp Business Account**
   - Business number different from test number
   - For testing labels, catalog, newsletters

### 2.2 Environment Configuration

Create `.env.test`:

```bash
# API Configuration
API_PORT=3000
API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_KEY=test-api-key-for-integration-tests
API_WEBHOOK_SECRET=test-webhook-secret

# Test Instance
TEST_INSTANCE_ID=integration-test-bot
TEST_SESSION_PATH=./test-sessions

# Test Contacts (real WhatsApp numbers)
TEST_CONTACT_A=6281234567890
TEST_CONTACT_B=6280987654321
TEST_GROUP_JID=123456789@g.us

# Timeouts
TEST_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=120000
TEST_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT=30000
TEST_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT=5000

# Test Webhook Server
TEST_WEBHOOK_PORT=3001
```

### 2.3 First-Time Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.test.example` to `.env.test`
3. Fill in real WhatsApp phone numbers
4. Run connection test first: `npm run test:integration -- setup`
5. Scan QR code when prompted
6. Session persists in `./test-sessions/`
7. Subsequent runs don't require QR scanning

## 6. Notes & Limitations

### 6.1 What's Possible

| Feature | Testable | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| All HTTP endpoints | Yes | Real HTTP calls to API |
| Instance lifecycle | Yes | Full CRUD, connection |
| Send messages | Yes | All message types to real WhatsApp |
| Receive messages | Yes | Trigger real messages, verify webhook |
| Webhook delivery | Yes | Test server receives events |
| Contact operations | Yes | Real number validation |
| Group operations | Yes | Real group management |
| Profile changes | Yes | Real profile updates |

### 6.2 What's Not Possible (or Difficult)

| Feature | Limitation | Workaround |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Parallel testing | Only one instance per phone number | Run tests sequentially |
| Multi-user testing | One WhatsApp number per test run | Use different test numbers |
| Speed | WhatsApp rate limits | Add delays between tests |
| Business features | Need Business account | Optional test category |
| CI/CD automation | Requires QR scanning | Manual or staging only |
| Message edit timeout | 15-minute window | Test immediately after sending |
| Newsletter owner | Need to be creator | Use test account as creator |

### 6.3 Known Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: WhatsApp may rate limit if sending too fast
   - Mitigation: Add 1-2 second delays between sends

2. **Session Expiry**: Sessions expire after inactivity
   - Mitigation: Re-run setup test when needed

3. **Network Dependencies**: Requires internet connection
   - Mitigation: Skip tests if offline

4. **Test Data Cleanup**: Messages sent to real contacts
   - Mitigation: Use dedicated test contacts

5. **Group State**: Repeated group operations may leave artifacts
   - Mitigation: Clean up test groups periodically

6. **Webhook Timing**: Events may arrive out of order
   - Mitigation: Use timestamps for ordering

### 6.4 Best Practices

1. **Before Running Tests**
   - Ensure test contacts are available
   - Verify network connection
   - Check test instance is connected

2. **During Tests**
   - Don't use the test phone for other activities
   - Let tests complete fully
   - Monitor webhook server logs

3. **After Tests**
   - Review test results
   - Clean up test groups if needed
   - Update test documentation

4. **Maintenance**
   - Rotate test contacts periodically
   - Update test data if contacts change
   - Re-pair if session expires

---

## 7. Test Maintenance

### 7.1 Adding New Tests

When adding new API endpoints:

1. Create test file in appropriate category
2. Add test cases to this document
3. Implement tests with real WhatsApp connection
4. Update test counts in documentation

### 7.2 Updating Tests

When API changes:

1. Update test expectations
2. Add new test cases for new features
3. Remove deprecated tests
4. Update test counts

### 7.3 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| QR timeout | Test fails to connect | Re-run setup, scan QR faster |
| Session expired | Tests fail with auth errors | Re-pair via setup test |
| Webhook not received | Test fails waiting for event | Check webhook server logs |
| Message not sent | Send returns error | Check phone number format |
| Rate limited | Messages fail with 429 | Add delays, retry later |

### 7.4 Test Data Rotation

Periodically rotate to avoid WhatsApp flags:

| Frequency | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Weekly | Restart test instance |
| Monthly | Re-pair (scan QR again) |
| Quarterly | Rotate test contacts |
